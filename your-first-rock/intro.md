### Welcome!

In this workshop, Let's write a simple `rockcraft.yaml` then build a rock from it.

You will be doing:
  - Install tools
  - Create sample .NET Web API app project from template then have a quick look
  - Draft `rockcraft.yaml`
  - Build a .NET Rock
  - Load the rock built into Docker
  - Test running rock with Docker
  - Modifying `rockcraft.yaml` to use `bare` base, .NET plugin and chiseled packages
  - Build then run the rock again
